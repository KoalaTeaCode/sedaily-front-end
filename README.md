## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Available API environments
In order to speed up configuration, you can use the API and event stream API's in other environments:
```
# serve with hot reload, using API running on staging
npm run dev:api-test

# serve with hot reload, using API running on production
npm run dev:api-prod
```
